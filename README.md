The Expense Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users record, manage, and analyze their daily expenses in a simple and organized way. The system allows users to add expenses by entering details such as expense title, category, amount, and date. All expenses are stored dynamically and displayed in a structured format for easy tracking.
The application provides a clear overview of spending patterns using interactive charts and summaries. Users can visualize their expenses category-wise and understand where their money is being spent. The interface is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, ensuring smooth usage across different devices.
This project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Chart.js, focusing on front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, form handling, data visualization, and responsive UI design. The Expense Tracker helps users improve financial awareness and serves as a practical implementation of real-world web development skills.
